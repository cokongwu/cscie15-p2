    <h1>XKCD Password Generator</h1>
    <h2>by Chinedu Okongwu</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>This is a password generator that combines a select number of words into a single password. The idea is to allow for a passphrase that is easier to remember and harder to crack than a single awkwardly spelled/mis-spelled word.</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
